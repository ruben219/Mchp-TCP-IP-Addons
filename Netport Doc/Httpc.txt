NOTES ON THE URL FIELD.

1) Using the default buffer limit of 125 bytes for TCP TX, the URL sent to the HTTP server should 
not be longer than 107 characters, due to the space reserved for method and protocol version on HTTP
while sending the request line to the server.

2) Using an URL longer that the space available on the TCP buffer will cause a client error and will
abort the HTTP request. The socket will be closed and no further headers or data will be exchanged.

3) The recommended length for the hostname string is 70 characters, this usually is enough for most
domain names.

3) Additional entity and other non standard headers can be sent by providing a pointer to a buffer
containing the null terminated string to be sent. All aditional headers should be terminated using 
\n\r characters. No specific limit exist for additional header data, even if you set this pointer
to point to an array larger than the available TCP buffer, the state machine will continue data
transfer as long as the connection is stablished and untill it finds the null terminator on the
provided buffer.

5) The maximum request entity body size is dictated by the size of the WORD type, this kind of
variable is 16 bit long, so a maximum size of 65535 bytes is allowed.
